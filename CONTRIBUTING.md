# How to contribute ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to k8s-crafts! Thanks for finding the time to contribute to the k8s-crafts projects!

We appreciate all contributions, whether they involve a large feature, a bug fix, or just an update to documentation. Please follow the guidelines below to make it easier for us to address your report and review your contributions.

## General guidelines

### Did you find a bug?

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/k8s-crafts/ephemeral-containers-plugin/issues).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, please [open a new one](https://github.com/k8s-crafts/ephemeral-containers-plugin/issues/new/choose). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

- When possible, please follow the available issue templates.


### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number in PR description if applicable (e.g. `Fixes #100`, `Related to #101`).

- The maintainers will get to your as soon as possible.

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

- Suggest your suggestions by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/k8s-crafts/ephemeral-containers-plugin/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature-requested&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFeature%5D+%3Ctitle%3E). Be sure to clearly state your ideas and any supporting reasons so we can have some contexts and grounds to validate them.

- You can also ask maintainers directly through our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/k8s-crafts). Generally, please use the GitHub issues.

### Do you want to suggest updates to documentations?

- Please [open a new issue](https://github.com/k8s-crafts/ephemeral-containers-plugin/issues/new) and clearly state your suggestions. All contributions are valuable even if it is just a typo.

- As of now, we don't have the capacities to provide documentations in languages (i.e. only English). If you can help us with that, we truly appreciate that. 

### Do you have questions about the source code?

- You can always ask maintainers directly through our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/k8s-crafts).
